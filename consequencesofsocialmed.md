# The Consequences of Social Media
The downsides of using social media and how they could affect users and their experience
## General Drawbacks
Unfortunately, **nearly uninhibited online communication does have its flaws**. While social media was intended to **allow everyone to freely express themselves through various forms of media and celebrate each other without judgement**, **it isn't a perfect system**. With heightened levels of **online vulnerability**, users can find themselves at the mercy of other users.

**General Downsides of Using Social Media Are:**
- Privacy isn't guaranteed
- It can negatively impact your mental, and sometimes physical, health
- It can negatively impact users' self-confidence and damage their perceptions of themselves and others due to peer pressure and societal expectations perpetuated by social media
- Users can be susceptible to various forms of fraud and scams
- Usage can become distracting and addicting (especially for younger generations)
- Cyberbullying (which can lead to in-person bullying too)
- Misinformation can be reached and spread by a widespread audience which can make it hard for it to be fact-checked and corrected
- Hacking can lead to leaked private information and the hacking of other individuals connected to the hacked user
- Reputations can be tarnished and ruined even if the justification for the online attack is inaccurate/untrue

## Combatting the Negative Effects of Social Media
While the consequences of social media can take a toll on users, there are ways users are fighting back. Many users who experience psychological effects from social media usage may seek out therapy or counseling to improve their mental health, self-image, or negative mindsets. If users are struggling to separate themselves from their social image and alleviate the effects of social media on their conscience, they may choose to temporarily deactivate their account or permanently delete social media. We have commonly seen celebrities take breaks from social media following public scrutiny or because of privacy concerns. However, it's becoming more common for younger generations to take breaks from social media in the name of "bettering themselves" or to "experience life to the fullest".

In regards to bullying, users are able to block or mute other users who harass them. Additionally, many social media platforms offer ways to report cyberbullies. These reports get reviewed and the perpetrators can be subject to getting banned or restricted. Social media platforms are becoming increasingly better at enforcing guideline restrictions and provide a larger selection of self-reporting options. On some platforms, such as Instagram, there are ways to report posts that attempt to spread misinformation. These posts may be labelled as misinformation or inaccurate so users aren't misled upon seeing them. Additionally, users who notice that posts may contain false information will occasionally attempt to correct those mistakes either in their own posts or in the comments of the orginal post.
