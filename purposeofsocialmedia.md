# What are the general purposes of social media?
Social media is an internet-based way for users, businesses, public figures, organizations and more to communicate with others by sharing content. Commentary on shared content can help shape media culture and the way we perceive it. From memes to politics, topics can drastically vary espsecially in severity and relevancy. User content can go viral, create revenue through sales or ads, or cause individuals or companies to even get "cancelled". One's reputation can be tarnished or amplified with the help of social media. Additionally, information, especially misinformation, can spread like wildfire because of how accessible user content is. Virality and relevancy of the content and individual(s) involved also influences the magnitude of consequences from user perceptions.
