## Permissions
Oftentimes, social media platforms will request access to a user's location, phone number contacts, and other apps to allow for a more personalized experience. Users can more easily befriend others who use the app or even invite them to start using the app which helps expand the userbase. Additionally, these platforms will have users agree to cookies to cater ads to the user's tastes based on their data. While most of these features aren't necessary for the main functionality of the app, they are helpful to have if you plan on utilizing certain features. Those concerned with security may opt out of these permissions and will only agree to the required terms and conditions along with the necessary features for the platform.
