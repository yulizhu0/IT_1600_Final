# Defining Social Media
What is social media and when did it start?

## The Definition
Social Media can be defined as **"the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks"** (Social Media Overview. Communications. (2021, March 5). Retrieved December 6, 2022, from https://communications.tufts.edu/marketing-and-branding/social-media-overview/).

## How is Social Media Used?
**Social media is popularly seen and used in the form of mobile applications (apps) and networking websites** such as Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and many more. Each of these social media platforms have their own **personalities** and **unique userbase**. Additionally, **these platforms have distinctive features that distinguish them from each other**. However, some social media platforms have implemented successful features from other platforms to increase their appeal to current, former, and future users.

## What makes Social Media interesting?
**Social media**, similar to the internet, **allows users to post almost anything**. While many of them do have guidelines that limit some forms of content (e.g. violence or nudity) to be uploaded, many users can usually get away with posting whatever they want. Since anybody can make and use a social media account as long as they aren't banned or restricted, **anybody can instantly share any content on their account**. So long as users have access to other people's feeds and timelines and those people have access to theirs, mass communication occurs. **The capacity for users to share, digest, and comment on content influences the way people perceive the world, comedy, culture, each other, themselves, and more**.
